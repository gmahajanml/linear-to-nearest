# Matlab/Octave Source code for Least Squares and Nearest Neighbors
This is a supporting code for the [blog post](https://gmahajanml.github.io/Least-Squares-and-Nearest-Neighbors/) discussing
least squares and nearest neighbors.

##Sample Usage
```matlab
clear all; close all;
[X_pos, X_neg] = generate_scenerio2();
run_linear(X_pos, X_neg);
run_nearest(X_pos, X_neg);
```
